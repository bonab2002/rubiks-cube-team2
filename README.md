# Rubik's Cube (Team 2) 

This repository contains Team 2's work for BUHPC's Rubik's Cube Project.

Our current goal is to study Ben Bellerose's program for solving the Rubik's Cube then optimize it. You can find it here: https://github.com/bellerb/RubiksCube_Solver

Once that is completed, we will proceed to create a 3d simulator to animate the program.
